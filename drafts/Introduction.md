## Welcome!

My name is Paul, and In this blog I will provide a leftist view of AI and our future in a world of increasingly capable AI systems.

I hope that this blog can be a way to openly express my understanding and new Ideas in AI ethics, which may help others develop their own views on this increasingly prevalent topic. 

## About Me
![alt text](/images/profilepic.png)
I graduated from UC Berkeley with a Bachelors of Arts in Data Science December 2022. I work as a Machine Learning Engineer. I am also a masters student at Georgia Tech studying Computer Science. 

## Who Is This Blog For
Anyone who is interested in AI but may have also become fed up with the political and philosophical homogeneity within the AI landscape. I plan to include a balanced blend of technical, political and philosophical topics. Some books that were influential to my views on these topics include:

- [```"Race After Technology" Ruha Benjamin```](https://www.ruhabenjamin.com/race-after-technology)
- [```"Weapons of Math Destruction" By Cathy O'Neil```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapons_of_Math_Destruction)
- [```"Are Prisons Obsolete?" Angela Davis```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Are_Prisons_Obsolete%3F)
- [```"Aphro-ism" Syl and Aph Ko```](https://lanternpm.org/book/aphro-ism/)
- [```"Full Automated Luxury Communism" Aaron Bastani```](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fully_Automated_Luxury_Communism)

If you also have found yourself aligning with the ideas proposed in these books than than this blog may be for you; however, even if you had not yet had a chance to read these books or dont agree with all of them, I still encourage you to follow along as my writing is intended for everyone. 

Furthermore, my writing is not meant to copy or regurgitate the ideas from the authors above, rather, I wanted to share these books so you could get an initial feel of what inspired me and shaped my views on these topics. With that being said, my views are ever evolving as I learn more through my work, reading and academic studies. 

## What to Expect Next
I plan on covering a broad range of topics within AI like the future of work, how data can be manipulated and bias in machine learning to name a few. 

I will try to post once a week; however, I am new to blogging, so the schedule is tentative currently.

## Closing Note
Thank you for stopping by :]
